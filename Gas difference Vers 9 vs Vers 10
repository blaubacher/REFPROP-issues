We work with high pressure gas mixtures, primarily Argon, Oxygen, and Helium.  I have noticed that there are as much as 10 percent difference between the density and compressibility values between the two versions of the codes.  The conditions run were a 70/20/10 mole fractions of Argon/O2/He at 350K, and 65 MPa.  We also ran 30 MPa, and the results between versions was closer, at just a few percent.  Does anyone know why the differences exist between versions?  For the gas mixtures, linear binary behavior was imposed.  Thanks very much.
